//object 

// This is the fist method for object declaration

const student = {

    firstName: "Bennison",
    age: 20
};

console.log(typeof person);  //object



//You can define object in a single line

const person1 = {name: "Bennison", age: 21 }; 

// In the above name and age are keys, and Bennison
// and 21 are values respectively. 


// "key: value" --> this pair is called properties.


// firstName: "Bennison"  ---> this is a property.
